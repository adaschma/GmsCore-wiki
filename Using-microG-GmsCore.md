* You can test Google Cloud Messaging using [this test application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firstrowria.pushnotificationtester). Push notifications do not require account registration.
* You can add an account through the system settings. Some applications might ask you to do so, if you don't.
* Use your applications as you like. But note that apps that use Cloud Messaging must be installed after GmsCore, else they will not work. Some hint of applications that can run due to microG GmsCore: TextSecure/Signal, Play Music, YouTube
* When using AdAway make sure to put mtalk.google.com on your whitelist, else problems are likely to occur when using Google Cloud Messaging. Thanks [@benstyle1 on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5459278) for the hint.
