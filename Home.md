microG GmsCore is a FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) framework to allow applications designed for Google Play Services to run on systems, where Play Services is not available. If you use your phone without GAPPS this might become a useful tool for you. This is currently alpha-grade Software. **Don't use it if you're not aware of possible consequences. Possible consequences include that your very private data leaks to Fort Meade.**

### Please report bugs
This project is still rather unstable. Please report bugs as they occur. Whenever you report a bug, please tell us what application caused the bug, including its exact version. If you're the developer, name the play services library you are using. Please do not bother the original app author when it might be related to microG services. If you created a logcat, but fear or know it contains sensitive data, you can send me a private message. If the problem is related to geolocation with UnifiedNlp, report it in the UnifiedNlp thread, even if you're using it through GmsCore.

### Thanks
Big thanks to everyone who continuously supported me doing this, by donating, pull-requests or just feedback.
