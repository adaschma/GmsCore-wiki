* You can test Google Cloud Messaging using [this test application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firstrowria.pushnotificationtester)*. Push notifications do not require account registration.
* You can add an account through the system settings. Some applications might ask you to do so, if you don't.
